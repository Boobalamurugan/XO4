    <h1>Welcome to XO<sup>4</sup></h1>
    <h5>A Strategic Twist on the Classic!</h5>
    <p>Step into the next level of the beloved Tic-Tac-Toe game with our new 4x4 XO grid. It's not just about filling rows and columns anymore – strategy and careful planning are key to winning this battle of X's and O's!</p>

    <!-- Box for "How to Play" -->
    <div class="box">
    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two players compete on a 4x4 (16) boxes.</li>
            <li>Take turns placing your symbol (‘X’ or ‘O’) on any empty cell.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>But there’s a twist!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If no one wins after all cells are filled, the game isn't over yet. We’ll count the number of "two-in-a-row" patterns for both players in vertical and horizontal directions.</li>
            <li>The player with the most "two-in-a-row" combinations becomes the ultimate winner.</li>
            <li>If both players tie, the game ends in a draw.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
